# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 (v3.0.0) of the Claude-Slack system has been successfully implemented on the `phase-2-permission-system` branch. This phase introduces a unified channel system with robust permission controls, treating DMs as private channels.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (v3)
- **File**: `template/global/mcp/claude-slack/db/schema_v3.sql`
- **Features**:
  - Unified `channels` table supporting both regular channels and DMs
  - `channel_members` table for explicit membership management
  - `dm_permissions` table for DM allow/block lists
  - Agent DM policies (open/restricted/closed)
  - Pre-allocated fields for Phase 1 (v3.1.0)

### 2. Permission Views
- **agent_channels**: Returns all channels accessible to an agent
- **dm_access**: Determines if two agents can DM each other
- **shared_channels**: Shows channels shared between projects
- **dm_channel_lookup**: Helper for consistent DM channel ID generation

### 3. Database Manager v3
- **File**: `template/global/mcp/claude-slack/db/manager_v3.py`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `create_channel()`: Creates channels with access types (open/members/private)
  - `create_or_get_dm_channel()`: Creates DM as a private channel
  - `add_channel_member()`: Manages channel membership
  - `send_message()`: Unified message sending with permission checks
  - `get_agent_channels()`: Uses permission view for access control
  - `search_messages()`: Respects channel permissions in search

### 4. Test Suite
- **Core Tests** (`tests/test_phase2_core.py`):
  - Channel creation with access types
  - DM as channels implementation
  - Access control enforcement
  - Permission view validation
  - DM permission policies
  - Cross-project channels

- **Integration Tests** (`tests/test_phase2_integration.py`):
  - Cross-project DM workflows
  - Channel membership lifecycle
  - Message routing isolation
  - DM policy enforcement
  - Search with permissions
  - Mixed scope interactions

- **Smoke Test** (`tests/test_phase2_smoke.sh`):
  - Quick verification script for all tests

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. DMs as Channels
- DMs are now private channels with exactly 2 members
- Channel ID format: `dm:{agent1}:{proj1}:{agent2}:{proj2}`
- Consistent ordering ensures single channel per agent pair

### 2. Three Access Types
- **Open**: Anyone can subscribe (traditional channels)
- **Members**: Invite-only, flexible membership
- **Private**: Fixed membership (used for DMs)

### 3. DM Policies
- **Open**: Accept DMs from anyone
- **Restricted**: Only from allowlist
- **Closed**: No DMs allowed
- Block lists override open policies

### 4. Database-Level Permissions
- All permission logic in SQL views
- No application-level filtering needed
- Single source of truth for access control

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 6/6 Core functionality tests
- ✅ 6/6 Integration tests
- ✅ Complete smoke test suite

## Migration Strategy

Since backward compatibility is not required:
1. Fresh installation uses `schema_v3.sql`
2. New `DatabaseManagerV3` replaces old manager
3. MCP tools will be updated in next phase

## Next Steps

### Remaining Phase 2 Tasks
1. Update ChannelManager for new access types
2. Unify MCP messaging tools (send_message instead of separate send_channel_message/send_direct_message)

### Phase 1 (v3.1.0) Preparation
The schema includes pre-allocated fields for Phase 1:
- Topic fields in channels and messages tables
- Agent message state table
- AI metadata fields
- Notification preferences in channel_members

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `template/global/mcp/claude-slack/db/schema_v3.sql`
- `template/global/mcp/claude-slack/db/manager_v3.py`
- `tests/test_phase2_core.py`
- `tests/test_phase2_integration.py`
- `tests/test_phase2_smoke.sh`
- `docs/phase-2-implementation-summary.md`

### Branch
All changes are on the `phase-2-permission-system` branch.

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- aiosqlite
- SQLite 3.35+ (for JSON support and CTEs)

### Performance Considerations
- Extensive indexing on permission-critical columns
- Views use efficient JOIN patterns
- Denormalized fields where needed for performance

### Security Considerations
- All access checks at database level
- No bypassing of permission views
- Explicit permission model (deny by default)

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully establishes a robust permission foundation for the Claude-Slack system. The unified channel approach simplifies the codebase while providing flexible access control. With DMs as channels, all future features (topics, state tracking, mentions) will automatically work for both channels and DMs without duplication.
