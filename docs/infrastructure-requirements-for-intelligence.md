# Infrastructure Requirements for Intelligence Layer
## How Claude-Slack Must Evolve to Support Claude-Brain

### Executive Summary

Claude-slack will serve as the **infrastructure layer** providing sophisticated information storage and retrieval capabilities, while claude-brain will be the **intelligence layer** that interprets and synthesizes this information into actionable context. 

This document defines the infrastructure requirements needed to support any intelligence pattern, focusing on multi-dimensional categorization, temporal indexing, relationship graphs, and high-performance retrieval.

### Architectural Principle

**Claude-slack is unopinionated about meaning but highly sophisticated about structure.**

Like a library that organizes books without interpreting them, claude-slack provides rich organizational capabilities while claude-brain provides the interpretation and synthesis.

## Multi-Dimensional Categorization

### The Problem
Information doesn't fit in single categories. A message about a bug fix in the authentication API is simultaneously:
- A bug fix (intent)
- About authentication (domain)
- Related to the API (component)
- Part of sprint 23 (temporal)
- High priority (urgency)
- From an expert (authority)

### The Solution: Orthogonal Categorization Dimensions

#### 1. Spatial Hierarchy (WHERE)
```
Channels → Topics → Messages → Fragments
```
- **Channels**: Broad containers (`global:general`, `proj_x:backend`)
- **Topics**: Focused threads with lifecycle (`bug-1234`, `api-v2-design`)
- **Messages**: Atomic units of information
- **Fragments**: Sub-message concepts (future)

#### 2. Semantic Tags (WHAT)
Hierarchical namespaced tags that can be combined:
```
#domain:backend:api
#intent:bugfix:critical
#pattern:factory:abstract
#status:blocked:needs-review
#quality:experimental
#expertise:required:senior
```

#### 3. Temporal Markers (WHEN)
Multiple time dimensions:
- Absolute: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `expires_at`
- Relative: `age_seconds`, `recency_score`
- Lifecycle: `active`, `resolved`, `archived`

#### 4. Relationships (HOW CONNECTED)
First-class relationship storage:
```
message_123 --depends_on--> message_456
message_789 --supersedes--> message_123
message_234 --implements--> decision_567
```

## Temporal Architecture

### Beyond Timestamps

Time in an intelligence system isn't just about when something happened, but about:

#### 1. Recency Decay
```python
recency_score = 1.0 * math.exp(-age_hours / half_life_hours)
```
- Fresh information (< 1 hour): score ≈ 1.0
- Recent information (< 24 hours): score ≈ 0.7
- Aging information (< 1 week): score ≈ 0.3
- Historical (> 1 month): score ≈ 0.05

#### 2. Temporal Relationships
- **Causal**: A caused B
- **Sequential**: A before B before C
- **Concurrent**: A during B
- **Superseding**: A replaced by B

#### 3. Temporal Windows
- Active window: Currently relevant
- Reference window: Recently relevant
- Historical window: Archival value

## Relationship Graph

### First-Class Relationships

Information forms a rich graph where relationships are as important as the nodes:

#### Core Relationship Types

**Structural Relationships**
- `parent/child`: Hierarchical containment
- `sibling`: Same parent relationship
- `part_of/contains`: Composition

**Semantic Relationships**
- `relates_to`: General association
- `depends_on`: Prerequisite
- `blocks`: Prevents progress
- `implements`: Realizes abstract concept
- `refactors`: Improves existing
- `fixes`: Resolves issue
- `documents`: Explains

**Social Relationships**
- `mentions`: References agent
- `responds_to`: Conversation flow
- `reviews`: Provides feedback
- `teaches/learns_from`: Knowledge transfer

**Evolutionary Relationships**
- `supersedes`: Replaces older version
- `fork_of`: Creates variant
- `merge_of`: Combines multiple
- `backport_of`: Retrofits to older version

### Graph Storage Requirements

```sql
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    source_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    relationship_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    strength FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0,  -- 0.0 to 1.0
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (source_id, target_id, relationship_type),
    INDEX idx_target (target_id, relationship_type),
    INDEX idx_type (relationship_type)
);
```

## Metadata Architecture

### Rich Metadata for Every Information Unit

```json
{
  "core": {
    "id": "msg_123",
    "content": "Actual message content",
    "channel_id": "proj_x:backend",
    "topic_id": "api-refactor"
  },
  
  "categorization": {
    "tags": ["#api", "#refactor", "#breaking-change"],
    "intent": "proposal",
    "artifact_type": "design_decision",
    "domain": ["backend", "api", "authentication"]
  },
  
  "temporal": {
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
    "recency_score": 0.85,
    "lifecycle_phase": "active",
    "ttl_seconds": 604800
  },
  
  "attribution": {
    "author": "backend-engineer",
    "project_id": "proj_abc123",
    "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "authority_level": "expert",
    "verification_status": "peer_reviewed"
  },
  
  "quality": {
    "completeness": 0.8,
    "clarity": 0.9,
    "accuracy": 0.95,
    "impact": "high",
    "risk": "medium"
  },
  
  "intelligence_hints": {
    "summary": "Proposes breaking API changes",
    "keywords": ["api", "v2", "breaking"],
    "sentiment": 0.3,
    "urgency": 0.7,
    "complexity": 0.6
  }
}
```

## Query Patterns

### Essential Query Capabilities

#### 1. Multi-Dimensional Filtering
```sql
-- Find recent, high-confidence API discussions from experts
SELECT * FROM messages m
WHERE 
  m.recency_score > 0.7
  AND m.confidence > 0.8
  AND '#api' = ANY(m.tags)
  AND m.authority_level = 'expert'
  AND m.lifecycle_phase = 'active';
```

#### 2. Graph Traversal
```sql
-- Find all context related to a message
WITH RECURSIVE context AS (
  SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id = 'msg_123'
  UNION
  SELECT m.* FROM messages m
  JOIN relationships r ON m.id = r.target_id
  JOIN context c ON r.source_id = c.id
  WHERE r.relationship_type IN ('depends_on', 'relates_to', 'implements')
)
SELECT * FROM context;
```

#### 3. Pattern Extraction
```sql
-- Find recurring solution patterns
SELECT 
  pattern_signature,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  AVG(success_score) as effectiveness
FROM extracted_patterns
WHERE domain = 'authentication'
GROUP BY pattern_signature
HAVING frequency > 3
ORDER BY effectiveness DESC;
```

#### 4. Temporal Correlation
```sql
-- Find what happens before failures
SELECT 
  preceding_action,
  COUNT(*) as occurrence_count
FROM (
  SELECT 
    LAG(action_type) OVER (ORDER BY created_at) as preceding_action
  FROM agent_actions
  WHERE outcome = 'failure'
) temporal_analysis
GROUP BY preceding_action
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
```

## Performance Requirements

### Query Performance Targets
- Simple retrieval: < 10ms
- Multi-dimensional filter: < 50ms
- Graph traversal (3 hops): < 100ms
- Pattern extraction: < 200ms
- Full-text search: < 100ms

### Scale Targets
- 1M+ messages
- 100K+ topics
- 10M+ relationships
- 1000+ concurrent queries
- 100+ messages/second ingestion

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Composite Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_active_recent_tagged ON messages(
  recency_score DESC,
  lifecycle_phase,
  channel_id
) WHERE lifecycle_phase = 'active';
```

#### 2. Materialized Views
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW active_context AS
SELECT 
  m.*,
  array_agg(t.tag) as all_tags,
  count(r.id) as relationship_count
FROM messages m
LEFT JOIN tags t ON m.id = t.message_id
LEFT JOIN relationships r ON m.id = r.source_id
WHERE m.recency_score > 0.3
GROUP BY m.id
REFRESH EVERY 1 MINUTE;
```

#### 3. Time-Based Partitioning
- Partition by week/month
- Archive old partitions
- Query recent partitions first

## Conclusion

Claude-slack must evolve from a simple messaging system to a sophisticated information infrastructure that can support complex intelligence operations. By implementing multi-dimensional categorization, temporal indexing, relationship graphs, and optimized query patterns, we create the foundation for claude-brain to deliver rapid agent effectiveness.

The infrastructure remains unopinionated about what information means, but provides rich capabilities for organizing, relating, and retrieving it. This separation of concerns allows both systems to evolve independently while working together to minimize agent time-to-effectiveness.

### Next Steps

1. Implement mandatory topics and state tracking (v3.1.0)
2. Design relationship storage schema
3. Prototype hierarchical tagging system
4. Benchmark query performance
5. Build infrastructure monitoring dashboard
