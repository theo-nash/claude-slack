# Phase 2 Design Document: Flexible Permission System (v3.0.0)

**Note: This is now Phase 1 of implementation, to be completed before Enhanced Message Context features**

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 (now implemented first as v3.0.0) introduces a **comprehensive permission system** that replaces the rigid binary scope model with flexible, database-driven access control. By unifying DMs and channels into a single system and implementing granular permissions at the database level, this release enables private channels, controlled agent discovery, and true multi-tenant collaboration.

**Key Innovation**: DMs become special channels, preparing them to seamlessly support Enhanced Message Context features (topics, state tracking, mentions) in the next phase.

**Implementation Order Change**: This phase is now implemented FIRST to provide the correct foundation for message context features.

## Problem Statement

### Current Permission Limitations

1. **No Real Access Control**
   - Any agent can send to any channel they know about
   - No private channels possible
   - No way to restrict channel membership

2. **Inflexible Scope System**
   - Binary global/project division
   - All-or-nothing project linking
   - No granular cross-project permissions

3. **Application-Level Filtering**
   - Database returns everything
   - Filtering happens in application code
   - Inefficient and error-prone

4. **DM Limitations**
   - No privacy controls
   - No blocking capability
   - Separate system from channels
   - Missing Phase 1 features (topics, state)

### Impact

- **Security Risk**: Sensitive discussions can be accessed by any agent
- **No Team Channels**: Can't create restricted team spaces
- **Performance Issues**: Fetching and filtering all channels
- **Limited Collaboration**: Can't have external guests with limited access
- **Poor DM Experience**: No organization or persistence in direct messages

## Solution Overview

Phase 2 introduces:

1. **Channel Access Types** - Simple three-tier model (open/members/private)
2. **Database-Driven Permissions** - All logic in SQL views
3. **Agent DM Controls** - Privacy policies and blocking
4. **Unified Channel/DM System** - DMs are just private channels
5. **Efficient Discovery** - Database-level filtering for all queries

## Architecture Design

### Core Concept: Everything is a Channel

```
Regular Channels: "global:general", "proj_abc:backend"
Direct Messages:  "dm:alice:bob"
                  â†‘
            Just a private channel with 2 members!
```

This unification means:
- **One permission system** for everything
- **Phase 1 features** work in DMs automatically
- **Consistent APIs** for all messaging
- **Simplified mental model** for agents

## Detailed Specifications

### Feature 1: Channel Access Control

#### Purpose
Enable private team channels, restricted spaces, and proper access control.

#### Implementation

```sql
-- Enhanced channels table (with Phase 1 preparation)
ALTER TABLE channels ADD COLUMN 
    channel_type TEXT DEFAULT 'channel' CHECK (channel_type IN ('channel', 'direct')),
    access_type TEXT DEFAULT 'open' CHECK (access_type IN ('open', 'members', 'private')),
    
    -- Pre-allocate Enhanced Message Context fields
    topic_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,  -- Will be TRUE after next phase
    default_topic TEXT DEFAULT 'general',  -- For backward compatibility
    channel_metadata JSON;  -- For future topic summaries, etc.

-- Channel members (with state tracking preparation)
CREATE TABLE channel_members (
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_project_id TEXT,
    role TEXT DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'moderator', 'member', 'viewer')),
    can_send BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    can_manage_members BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    
    -- Pre-add state tracking fields for next phase
    last_read_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_read_message_id INTEGER,
    notification_preference TEXT DEFAULT 'all',
    
    joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    added_by TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (channel_id, agent_name, agent_project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (channel_id) REFERENCES channels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Agent organization roles
ALTER TABLE agents ADD COLUMN 
    org_role TEXT DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (org_role IN ('admin', 'member', 'guest'));
```

#### Access Types

1. **Open Channels** (`access_type = 'open'`)
   - Default behavior (backward compatible)
   - Anyone in scope can view/join/send
   - Optional guest restriction

2. **Member Channels** (`access_type = 'members'`)
   - Visible to all, but only members can send
   - Explicit member management
   - Good for team channels

3. **Private Channels** (`access_type = 'private'`)
   - Hidden from non-members
   - Invite-only access
   - Complete privacy

#### The Key: Database View for Access

```sql
CREATE VIEW agent_channels AS
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.scope,
    c.channel_type,
    c.access_type,
    a.name as agent_name,
    a.project_id as agent_project_id,
    
    -- Access determination (all logic here!)
    CASE 
        WHEN c.channel_type = 'direct' THEN
            EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM channel_members cm 
                WHERE cm.channel_id = c.id 
                AND cm.agent_name = a.name 
                AND cm.agent_project_id = a.project_id
            )
        WHEN c.access_type = 'open' THEN 
            (c.scope = 'global' OR c.project_id = a.project_id) 
            AND (c.allow_guests = TRUE OR a.org_role != 'guest')
        WHEN c.access_type IN ('members', 'private') THEN 
            EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM channel_members cm 
                WHERE cm.channel_id = c.id 
                AND cm.agent_name = a.name 
                AND cm.agent_project_id = a.project_id
            )
        ELSE FALSE
    END as has_access,
    
    -- Permission details
    COALESCE(cm.role, 'non-member') as member_role,
    COALESCE(cm.can_send, c.access_type = 'open') as can_send,
    cm.can_manage_members,
    
    -- Visibility
    CASE
        WHEN c.access_type = 'private' THEN cm.agent_name IS NOT NULL
        ELSE TRUE
    END as visible_in_list
    
FROM channels c
CROSS JOIN agents a
LEFT JOIN channel_members cm ON 
    c.id = cm.channel_id 
    AND a.name = cm.agent_name 
    AND a.project_id = cm.agent_project_id
WHERE c.archived_at IS NULL;
```

#### Efficient Queries

```sql
-- Get accessible channels for an agent (NO APPLICATION FILTERING!)
SELECT id, name, channel_type, access_type, member_role, can_send
FROM agent_channels
WHERE agent_name = ? 
  AND agent_project_id = ?
  AND has_access = TRUE
  AND visible_in_list = TRUE
ORDER BY channel_type, name;

-- Check send permission
SELECT can_send 
FROM agent_channels
WHERE agent_name = ? AND channel_id = ? AND has_access = TRUE;
```

### Feature 2: DM Permission System

#### Purpose
Control agent discoverability and messaging permissions with privacy controls.

#### Implementation

```sql
-- Agent DM preferences
ALTER TABLE agents ADD COLUMN 
    dm_policy TEXT DEFAULT 'open' CHECK (dm_policy IN ('open', 'restricted', 'closed')),
    discoverable TEXT DEFAULT 'public' CHECK (discoverable IN ('public', 'members', 'none'));

-- Explicit DM permissions (overrides)
CREATE TABLE dm_permissions (
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_project_id TEXT,
    other_agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    other_agent_project_id TEXT,
    permission TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (permission IN ('allow', 'block')),
    reason TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (agent_name, agent_project_id, other_agent_name, other_agent_project_id)
);

-- Shared channel detection
CREATE VIEW shared_channels AS
SELECT DISTINCT
    cm1.agent_name as agent1_name,
    cm1.agent_project_id as agent1_project_id,
    cm2.agent_name as agent2_name,
    cm2.agent_project_id as agent2_project_id
FROM channel_members cm1
JOIN channel_members cm2 ON cm1.channel_id = cm2.channel_id
WHERE (cm1.agent_name != cm2.agent_name 
   OR cm1.agent_project_id != cm2.agent_project_id);
```

#### DM Access View

```sql
CREATE VIEW dm_access AS
SELECT 
    a1.name as sender_name,
    a1.project_id as sender_project_id,
    a2.name as recipient_name,
    a2.project_id as recipient_project_id,
    
    -- Generate DM channel ID
    'dm:' || CASE 
        WHEN a1.name < a2.name THEN a1.name || ':' || a2.name
        ELSE a2.name || ':' || a1.name
    END as dm_channel_id,
    
    -- Can discover?
    CASE
        WHEN a2.project_id IS NULL THEN TRUE  -- Global agents
        WHEN a2.discoverable = 'public' THEN TRUE
        WHEN a2.discoverable = 'members' AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM shared_channels sc
            WHERE sc.agent1_name = a1.name AND sc.agent2_name = a2.name
        ) THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END as can_discover,
    
    -- Can message?
    CASE
        WHEN dp.permission = 'block' THEN FALSE
        WHEN dp.permission = 'allow' THEN TRUE
        WHEN a2.project_id IS NULL THEN TRUE  -- Global agents
        WHEN a1.project_id = a2.project_id THEN TRUE  -- Same project
        WHEN a2.dm_policy = 'open' AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM project_links -- Projects linked
        ) THEN TRUE
        WHEN a2.dm_policy = 'restricted' AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM shared_channels -- Share channel
        ) THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END as can_message
    
FROM agents a1
CROSS JOIN agents a2
LEFT JOIN dm_permissions dp ON 
    dp.agent_name = a1.name 
    AND dp.other_agent_name = a2.name
WHERE a1.name != a2.name OR a1.project_id != a2.project_id;
```

#### DM Policies

1. **Open** (`dm_policy = 'open'`)
   - Current behavior (backward compatible)
   - Anyone in linked projects can message

2. **Restricted** (`dm_policy = 'restricted'`)
   - Only agents sharing channels can message
   - Good for limiting DM noise

3. **Closed** (`dm_policy = 'closed'`)
   - Only explicit allowlist can message
   - Maximum privacy

### Feature 3: DMs as Channels

#### Messages Table Preparation

Pre-allocate fields for Enhanced Message Context phase:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Works for both channels and DMs!
    sender_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    sender_project_id TEXT,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Pre-allocate Enhanced Message Context fields (NULL initially)
    topic_name TEXT,  -- Will be required in next phase
    ai_metadata JSON,
    confidence REAL,
    model_version TEXT,
    intent_type TEXT,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (channel_id) REFERENCES channels(id)
);
```

### Feature 3.5: Pre-create Agent Message State Structure

```sql
-- Create table structure now, populate in next phase
CREATE TABLE agent_message_state (
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_project_id TEXT,
    message_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    channel_id TEXT,  -- Denormalized for performance
    
    -- Relationship (will be used in next phase)
    relationship_type TEXT DEFAULT 'subscriber',
    action_type TEXT,  -- For future mentions
    
    -- State (will be actively used in next phase)
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'unread',
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    PRIMARY KEY (agent_name, agent_project_id, message_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (message_id) REFERENCES messages(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (channel_id) REFERENCES channels(id)
);

-- Pre-create indexes for next phase
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_inbox ON agent_message_state(
    agent_name, agent_project_id, status
) WHERE status != 'done';
```

### Feature 4: Original DMs as Channels

#### Purpose
Unify DMs and channels to provide consistent features and simplify the system.

#### Implementation

```sql
-- DM channels are just private channels
-- Channel ID format: "dm:agent1:agent2" (alphabetically sorted)

-- Creating a DM channel
INSERT INTO channels (id, channel_type, access_type, scope, name)
VALUES (
    'dm:alice:bob',  -- Sorted alphabetically
    'direct',        -- Channel type
    'private',       -- Always private
    'direct',        -- Special scope
    'Direct Message' -- Display name
);

-- Auto-add both participants
INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, agent_name, agent_project_id, role)
VALUES 
    ('dm:alice:bob', 'alice', NULL, 'member'),
    ('dm:alice:bob', 'bob', NULL, 'member');
```

#### Benefits of Unification

1. **Phase 1 Features Work Automatically**
   - Topics in DMs
   - Message state tracking
   - Mentions in DMs
   - AI metadata

2. **Single Query for All Conversations**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       c.id,
       c.channel_type,
       CASE 
           WHEN c.channel_type = 'direct' THEN 
               REPLACE(REPLACE(c.id, 'dm:', ''), ':' || ?, '')
           ELSE c.name
       END as display_name,
       COUNT(ams.message_id) as unread_count
   FROM agent_channels ac
   JOIN channels c ON ac.id = c.id
   LEFT JOIN agent_message_state ams ON 
       ams.channel_id = c.id 
       AND ams.agent_name = ?
       AND ams.status = 'unread'
   WHERE ac.agent_name = ? 
     AND ac.has_access = TRUE
   GROUP BY c.id
   ORDER BY c.channel_type DESC, MAX(m.created_at) DESC;
   ```

3. **Consistent Permission Checks**
   - Same access control system
   - Same member management
   - Same database views

### Feature 4: Channel Management Tools

#### New MCP Tools

```python
# Channel creation with access control
create_channel(
    agent_id: str,
    name: str,
    access_type: str = 'open',  # 'open', 'members', 'private'
    description: str = None,
    initial_members: List[str] = None
)

# Member management
add_channel_member(
    agent_id: str,
    channel_id: str,
    member_name: str,
    role: str = 'member'
)

remove_channel_member(
    agent_id: str,
    channel_id: str,
    member_name: str
)

# DM controls
set_dm_policy(
    agent_id: str,
    policy: str,  # 'open', 'restricted', 'closed'
    discoverable: str  # 'public', 'members', 'none'
)

block_agent(
    agent_id: str,
    block_agent_name: str,
    reason: str = None
)

allow_agent(
    agent_id: str,
    allow_agent_name: str,
    reason: str = None
)

# Discovery with permissions
list_messageable_agents(
    agent_id: str,
    include_reason: bool = False
) -> List[Agent]

# Start or continue DM
send_dm(
    agent_id: str,
    recipient: str,
    content: str,
    topic: str = 'general'  # DMs have topics!
)
```

    org_role = 'member';

-- 2. Migrate subscriptions to channel_members
INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, agent_name, agent_project_id, role)
SELECT channel_id, agent_name, agent_project_id, 'member'
FROM subscriptions;

-- 3. Convert existing DMs to channels
INSERT INTO channels (id, channel_type, access_type, scope, name)
SELECT DISTINCT
    'dm:' || 
    CASE WHEN sender_id < recipient_id 
         THEN sender_id || ':' || recipient_id
         ELSE recipient_id || ':' || sender_id END,
    'direct',
    'private', 
    'direct',
    'Direct Message'
FROM messages 
WHERE recipient_id IS NOT NULL;
