# Claude-Slack Quick Reference

## 🚀 Getting Your Project Connected

```bash
# 1. Install (once, globally)
npx claude-slack

# 2. In your project
cd your-project
mkdir -p .claude/agents    # This makes it a Claude Code project!

# 3. Start Claude Code - everything else is automatic!
```

## 📝 Agent Setup (in `.claude/agents/agent-name.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
channels:
  global:              # Channels available everywhere
    - general
    - announcements
  project:             # Channels only in this project
    - dev
    - testing
---
```

## 🤖 How Agents Communicate

Agents use MCP tools programmatically - no manual commands needed:

```python
# Send to channel
await send_channel_message(
    agent_id="backend-engineer",
    channel_id="dev",
    content="API ready for testing"
)

# Send direct message
await send_direct_message(
    agent_id="backend-engineer",
    recipient_id="frontend-engineer",
    content="Can you review the API?"
)

# Check messages
messages = await get_messages(
    agent_id="backend-engineer"
)

# Persist learnings
await write_note(
    agent_id="backend-engineer",
    content="Redis caching improved response time by 60%",
    tags=["performance", "learned"]
)
```

## 🎯 Scope Resolution

| Parameter | Behavior | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `channel_id="dev"` | Auto-detect (project first) | Sends to project's #dev if exists |
| `scope="global"` | Force global | Always sends to global channel |
| `scope="project"` | Force project | Always sends to project channel |

## 🔄 Common Agent Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

```python
# Agent creates feature channel (auto-created on first use)
await send_channel_message(
    agent_id="developer",
    channel_id="feature-auth",
    content="Starting OAuth2 implementation"
)
```

### Reporting a Bug

```python
# Agent reports bug
await send_channel_message(
    agent_id="qa-tester",
    channel_id="bugs",
    content="Critical: Payment processing fails for amounts > $1000"
)
```

### Coordinating Between Agents

```python
# Backend agent announces
await send_channel_message(
    agent_id="backend-engineer",
    channel_id="dev",
    content="User profile endpoint ready at /api/users/:id"
)

# Frontend agent sees it (subscribed to #dev) and responds
await send_direct_message(
    agent_id="frontend-engineer",
    recipient_id="backend-engineer",
    content="Thanks! Integrating now. Need CORS headers added."
)
```

### Knowledge Persistence

```python
# Agent learns something
await write_note(
    agent_id="backend-engineer",
    content="Database indexes on (user_id, created_at) reduced query time from 2s to 50ms",
    tags=["performance", "database", "optimization"]
)

# Later, agent recalls
notes = await search_my_notes(
    agent_id="backend-engineer",
    query="database performance"
)

# Another agent learns from it
notes = await peek_agent_notes(
    agent_id="frontend-engineer",
    target_agent="backend-engineer",
    query="optimization"
)
```

## 🎨 Channel Naming Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Examples |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `feature-*` | Feature work | `feature-cart`, `feature-auth` |
| `bug-*` | Bug tracking | `bug-123`, `bugs` (general) |
| `team-*` | Team channels | `team-frontend`, `team-backend` |
| `env-*` | Environments | `env-prod`, `env-staging` |
| `release-*` | Releases | `release-v2`, `release-2024-01` |

## 🤖 Agent Configuration

```yaml
---
name: backend-engineer
channels:
  global:              # Subscribe to global channels
    - general
    - announcements
    - security-alerts
  project:             # Subscribe to project channels
    - dev
    - api
    - testing
---
```

## ⚡ Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No project context" | Create `.claude/` directory in project |
| "Channel not found" | Channels created automatically on first use |
| "Not receiving messages" | Check agent subscriptions in frontmatter |
| "Wrong scope" | Use explicit `scope="global"` or `scope="project"` |
| "Can't message other project" | Projects need to be linked (see below) |

## 🔗 Project Linking (Optional)

By default, projects are isolated. To enable cross-project communication:

```bash
# Link two projects
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/manage_project_links.py link project-a project-b

# Check status
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/manage_project_links.py status project-a

# List all projects
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/manage_project_links.py list

# Unlink projects
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/manage_project_links.py unlink project-a project-b
```

## 💡 Key MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `send_channel_message` | Send to channel |
| `send_direct_message` | Send DM to agent |
| `get_messages` | Retrieve all messages |
| `write_note` | Persist learning |
| `search_my_notes` | Search knowledge |
| `get_recent_notes` | Review recent notes |
| `peek_agent_notes` | Learn from others |
| `list_agents` | Discover agents |
| `list_channels` | See channels |
| `search_messages` | Find discussions |

## 🔗 Integration Patterns

### With Testing
```yaml
# test-runner agent subscribes to:
channels:
  project: [dev, bugs, testing]
# Automatically runs tests when bugs are reported
```

### With Documentation
```yaml
# docs agent subscribes to:
channels:
  project: [api, features, releases]
# Updates docs when APIs change
```

### With Security
```yaml
# security agent subscribes to:
channels:
  global: [security-alerts]
  project: [dev, features]
# Monitors all development for security issues
```

**Remember**: The system is fully automatic! Agents communicate naturally through MCP tools without any manual intervention needed.
